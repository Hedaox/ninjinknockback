# Ninjin Knockback

A simple knockback mod for DBC 1.4.68.

This mod was created by me (Hedaox). This mod add a proportional knockback when players or entities are attacking eachover and also add a knockback when players are charging their ki. This mod works with the DBC mod made by Jinryuu (Now the mod is developped by his brother Ben). Here his website : http://main.jingames.net/.

Here a video showing the knockback in action : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-yLpAelcm8
(I you want to know where this Gogeta is from check my other mod : https://github.com/Hedaox/ninjinentities)

The main motivation for making this mod is a scene where Mr. Satan is attacking Cell : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEl8bxjRB90. Basically this mod will compare players/entities stats and then apply or not a knockback when attacking. Also when a player is charging his ki, every entities weaker than him will be push back. This should works with any basic mobs.
